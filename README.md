## ðŸ“Œ Projects Overview  

During my training, I worked on several machine learning projects that strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Below is a summary of the tasks:  

### ðŸ”¹ Customer Segmentation  
- Applied clustering techniques (K-Means) to group customers based on purchasing behavior and demographics.  
- Helped identify customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.  

### ðŸ”¹ Forest Cover Type Prediction  
- Built a classification model using cartographic features .  
- Predicted the type of forest cover with high accuracy.  

### ðŸ”¹ Loan Approval Prediction  
- Developed a supervised learning model to predict loan eligibility.  
- Used applicant financial and personal details for classification.  
- Evaluated results with accuracy, precision, and recall.  

### ðŸ”¹ Student Score Prediction  
- Implemented a regression model to predict student performance.  
- Features included study hours and related academic factors.  
- Measured performance with RMSE and RÂ² score.
